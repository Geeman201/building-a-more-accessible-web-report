\textasciitilde70\% of all websites are difficult to access for
users whom have a disability and rely upon assistive tools. With 20\% of the
population falling into this category companies are missing out
on \textasciitildeÂ£500 million in revenue due to their service being
inaccessible. More importantly this minority group is having to work around
poor design and development to utilise the common services we all take for
granted. This project aims to tackle the problem from the grass routes by
educating software engineers and making it easier to test for accessibility
issues early in the software development lifecycle.
