\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}
At a high level this project has achieved what it set out to do. A training
guide has been developed and a framework which enables identification of
accessibility issues created. The issues the tool identifies are limited but a
solid example of the `art of the possible' in finding these issues in web
pages is clear. This project has targetted developers which forms only half
the battle. Targetting designers is an area future work should be undertaken
in.
