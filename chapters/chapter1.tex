\section{Deliverables}
This project will produce three distinct deliverables. The first, a tool for software engineers which will bootstrap itself into a web
browser, assess and then report possible accessibility issues. The second, a suite of documentation which will demonstrate the issues, and
show engineers how to remediate the problems - these will be produced using the current most popular tooling. The third, this report. This
report will describe the journey, from researching the topic, to designing and building the tool.
