\chapter{Background}

\newthought{There's something to be said for}
the background chapter should provide a more in-depth survey of previous
related work.
The Introduction and Background sections should be answering the question
“What is the project trying to achieve, why that is important and how is it
different from previous work?”Include an analysis of the business context for
the project.

20\% of the UK population reported they have a disability in 2016, that is
approximately13.3 million people. In the physical world companies are by law
bound to ensurethat this group are able to access their services, be it by
leaving enough room to accomodate wheel chairs, or offering large text prints
of their products. In the digital world there are no such laws and thus the web can be a
difficult place for these users to consume services.

A range of assistive
tools aim to improve the experience by targeting a selection of
disabilities and offering other means to consume the content. For example
JAWS is aimed at users whom are visually impaired; reading the content,
labelling actions and additional keyboard shortcuts to navigate. The problem
with all these tools is that they rely upon Software Engineers to produce
content semantically (using HTML) and add metadata (WCAG) to enable the tools
to better process the content.

\subsubsection{Project Goals}
This project will produce three distinct deliverables. The first, a tool for software engineers which will bootstrap itself into a web
browser, assess and then report possible accessibility issues. The second, a suite of documentation which will demonstrate the issues, and
show engineers how to remediate the problems - these will be produced using the current most popular tooling. The third, this report,
this will describe the journey, from researching the topic, to designing and building the tool.
