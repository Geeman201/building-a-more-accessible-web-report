\newthought{20\% of the UK population reported they have a disability} in
2016, that is
approximately 13.3 million people. In the physical world companies are by law
bound to ensure that this minority are able to access their services, be it by
leaving enough room to accomodate wheel chairs, or offering large text prints
of their products. In the digital world there are no such laws and thus the web can be a
difficult place for these users to consume services and content.

A range of assistive
tools aim to improve the experience by targeting a selection of
disabilities and offering other means to consume the content. For example
JAWS is aimed at users whom are visually impaired; reading the content,
labelling actions and offering additional keyboard shortcuts to navigate. The
problem
with all these tools is that they rely upon Software Engineers to produce
content semantically (using HTML) and add metadata (WCAG) to enable the tools
to better process the content.

The core purpose of this project is to enable the development community to
produce content which is as 'accessible' as possible.

\subsubsection{What is accessibility?}

"Accessibility" is a subjective term which offers many opinionated
definitions. The Oxford English Dictionary defines accessiblity as:
\begin{quote}
"The quality of being able to be reached or entered"
\end{quote}

Focussing more towards the web, Tim Berners-Lee 'Inventor of the web' wrote:
\begin{quote}
"The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless
of disability is an essential aspect"
\end{quote}

Both of these point towards accessibility being the ability to access the
information on offer through the web but fail to demonstrate who is
responsible for enabling it.

Adobe are slightly more specific, they identify that designers and developers
 have a key part to play in enabling users to access content.

\begin{quote}
"How users with disabilities access electronic information and how web content
designers and developers enable web pages to function with assistive devices
used by individuals with disabilities"
\end{quote}

To me, accessibility is enabling users with disabilities to have an 'equally good'
experience as those whom are more able. Fundamentally, this begins at the
design level by comparing a range of user experiences to acheive the users
goal through different methods (Sound only, Keyboard only). Then the
responsibility of the developer is reduced to writing semantic well formed,
well ordered code.

\subsubsection{Business Context}
Capgemini undertakes a range of projects across both public and private
sector. In the current digital climate most projects involve the
development of some form of web frontend.

\subsubsection{Project Goals}
This project will produce three distinct deliverables. The first, a tool for software engineers which will bootstrap itself into a web
browser, assess and then report possible accessibility issues. The second, a suite of documentation which will demonstrate the issues, and
show engineers how to remediate the problems - these will be produced using the current most popular tooling. The third, this report,
this will describe the journey, from researching the topic, to designing and building the tool.
